Open source 2D Games using Love2D Game Engine (added some personal touch; unfinished, but executable)

Pre-Conditions:
1. Install Love2D v0.10.2 on computer;
2. Unzip "2D Games", put it somewhere (I put mine on "My Documents").

How to open a game:
1. Inside the 2D Games folder, choose which game you want to open;
2. Drag and drop its folder on the "love.exe" located probably on C:\Program Files\LOVE
